<h1>Phases of Year Up</h1>

<p>Year Up is divided into two different phases. The two phases of Year Up include Learning & Development (L&D) and Internship. Students will first begin the program with five vigorous months of training in a classroom setting, which is also known as the L&D phase. During the L&D phase, students gain background knowledge on hardware and software applications. They spend day to day business hours developing both technical and soft skills during this process. After the L&D phase, students enter the internship phase and go off to their given internship usually by the track they were placed in. Internship consists of a total of 6 months on the job training. Interns build a specialized skill set during this phase to help them gain skills for a real paying job after graduation.
