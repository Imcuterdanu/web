<h1>Phases of Year Up</h1>

<p>Year Up is divided into two different phases. The two phases of Year Up include Learning & Development (L&D) and Internship. Students will first begin the program with five vigorous months of training in a classroom setting, which is also known as the L&D phase. During the L&D phase, students gain background knowledge on hardware and software applications. They spend day to day business hours developing both technical and soft skills during this process. After the L&D phase, students enter the internship phase and go off to their given internship usually by the track they were placed in. Internship consists of a total of 6 months on the job training. Interns build a specialized skill set during this phase to help them gain skills for a real paying job after graduation.

<h2>Modules</h2>

<p2>Year Up is divided into three module in the L&D phase. L&D consists of twenty one weeks. Each module is 7 weeks long. During each module, students will be different tech skills. In the first module, students gain tech fundamentals and web development skills.  In the second module, students will switch courses from tech fundamental/ web development to IT help desk and system administration. The point of the first two modules is to develop a basic understanding of each area. Lastly, the students will go into module three. In the third module, students are transferred into the track that best fits them according to Year Up staff.</p2>
