<h1>What Is Year Up?</h1>

<p>That is a good question. I also asked myself that very same question when had I first enter the building, so you don’t need to feel alone. To summarize, Year Up is a yearlong program that grants motivated young adults a chance to succeed in the tech industry and get their foot into the corporate world. When applicants get their acceptance into the program, they go first through five intensive months of training during Learning and Development Phase which consists of three modules. After the Learning and Development Phase, students get placed into an internship according to their given tracks. Year Up has four different tracks and you are allowed to choose ONE track. Quality Assurance, Cyber Security, Program Management, and IT Help Desk.</p>
