<h1>What are the Major Topics Covered in Module 3?</h1>
<p>Some major topics that were covered in module 3: types of software bugs, software development life cycles, black box testing, white box testing, JavaScript, static & dynamic testing, test to pass or fail, version control software, specifications, software requirements, software guidelines, bug reports, cost of fixing bugs, how to examine specs, equivalence partitioning. This is the current list I have so far on the topic we have covered in only just two weeks. As the course goes by, we hope to continue to learn and study more on other topics such as automation, python, etc...</p>

<h2>Software Tools Used</h2>
<p2>Some software tools that were used during module 3 include: Version Control and Sublime text. Sublime text is a software that we used to input our HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. One version control software we used was in QA was GitHub. GitHub is a type of software tool used to track and record changes someone makes on their code. GitHub was an important software testing tool that we learned because it helped us track our progress and changes to every version we made. On that note, JIRA also has a similar concept to GitHub.</p2>

<p5><b>Examples of topics covered in class:</b><br>

<b>GitHub:</b> Created a personal account with GitHub. Downloaded the version control software onto the desktop and linked it to our webpages in order to track changes we made. 	<br>
<b>SDLC:</b> Assigned a software development model to every group in class, researched each cycle on the internet, presented it in front of peers to get an understanding of each cycle. A software development cycle is the steps developers take to produce software. Example: SPIRAL MODEL  Plan Objectives  >Identify Risk and Resolve > Development & Test > Plan Next Iteration</p5><br><br>

<p6><b>Textbook: Software Testing by Ron Patton - 2nd Edition</b></p4><br>
<p5>For module three, the textbook above was used to guide us through the course. This book has information on different type of testing (black and white box testing), types of bugs, software development life cycles, and so on. I would recommend students going into the QA track to read this book daily to gain background knowledge on software testing.</p6><br><br>

<p7><em>One famous bug that you should know of was the "Patriot Missile Mistiming" bug. This bug was famous because of a minor error in the system had become a major issue which caused a rocket to launch and eventually killing off 28 soliders and injuring 100 other people. This is a good example of why bugs should be fixed early on.</em></p7><br>

<h4>What I Found Most Interesting in QA</h4>
<p8>In my opinion, the most interesting part of QA was learning about the different types of bug out there. Did you know the cost of fixing a bug early on would be like $99999999 cheaper? I didn't either. To be honest, locating and finding bugs was pretty fun and subjective. There was no right or wrong answer. It all depended on how specified the specifications were. I also enjoyed creating the website project in class, even though it was such a struggle to fulfill ALL the requirements and specs. JavaScript was a pain as well, but we got through it eventually.</p8>
