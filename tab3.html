<h1>What are the Major Topics Covered in Module 3?</h1>
<p>Some major topics that were covered in module 3: types of software bugs, software development life cycles, black box testing, white box testing, JavaScript, static & dynamic testing, test to pass or fail, version control software, specifications, software requirements, software guidelines, bug reports, cost of fixing bugs, how to examine specs, equivalence partitioning. This is the current list I have so far on the topic we have covered in only just two weeks. As the course goes by, we hope to continue to learn and study more on other topics such as automation, python, etc...</p>


<h2>Software Tools Used</h2>
<p2>Some software tools that were used during module 3 include: Version Control and Sublime text. Sublime text is a software that we used to input our HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. One version control software we used was in QA was GitHub. GitHub is a type of software tool used to track and record changes someone makes on their code. GitHub was an important software testing tool that we learned because it helped us track our progress and changes to every version we made. On that note, JIRA also has a similar concept to GitHub.</p2><br>

<p3><b>Textbook: Software Testing by Ron Patton - 2nd Edition</b></p3><br>
<p4>For module three, the textbook above was used to guide us through the course. This book has information on different type of testing (black and white box testing), types of bugs, software development life cycles, and so on. I would recommend students going into the QA track to read this book daily to gain background knowledge on software testing.</p4><br>
